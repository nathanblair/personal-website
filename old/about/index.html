        <p>My name is Nathan Blair.</p>
        <p>
        I'm a proud millennial, tech enthusiast, and lifelong learner. I hold two Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. My alma mater is technically Wright State University in Dayton, OH but I attended the University of Cincinnati during my first three years of college and will always consider myself a Bearcat at heart.

        My areas of professional experience include steelmaking, steel forming, failure analysis, MEMS, electronic device characterization and fabrication, software development, and swimming pool maintenance. I'm an extremely diverse individual and have a wide array of interests. It stems from the fact that I have an addiction to solving challenging problems and a never-ending desire to learn.

        <p>
        Outside of my professional life I am an avid motorcyclist and musician. When I'm not riding my Buell X1 Lightning, I can be found jamming on drum sets, guitar, and occassionally the piano. My personal aspirations are to just be a good person each day, leaving the world a little better than the day before. To accomplish this on a larger scale I am committed to advocating renewable and sustainable energy technology and helping those that live a life less fortunate than I.

        I'm interested in talking with people that share my commitment to continuous education, a sustainable world, and open-mindedness. I see a lot of potential in my generation to shape the world and I'm always open to having discussions about ways to improve our future. Contact me if you want to chat about cool things or would like to work on a project with me!
