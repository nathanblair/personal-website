  <p>
    Much to the dismay of my SO, I've been spending most of my weekend and the
    start of this week testing some new Linux distros rather than doing house
    chores. Sorry bae. But let's talk about some of the experiences I've had
    with testing some of these distros!
  </p>

  <h4>Ubuntu Mate 17.04</h4>

  <p>
    This was to be my daily driver (I had Ubuntu Mate 16.04 running until the
    release of 17.04). It works great, Mate is smooth, responsive, and Ubuntu
    and its package management/Debian base means I have almost any software I
    could want at my disposal. My Linux machine had been running as a VM under
    Windows 10 because all of these tests were done on a laptop and Windows gets
    better battery life even when running Linux under a VM. So it was important
    to have a pretty lightweight, but still very capable, system. Mate fits that
    configuration perfectly.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet, my appreciation for the sentiment of open-source means I would
    rather support a distribution that relies primarily on itself or is derived
    from only other community built distros. Canonical is a very capable company
    and Ubuntu has had its ups and downs, and I believe Ubuntu is a great choice
    for many people. But for myself, I desired something...else.
  </p>

  <h4>Enter Arch/Manjaro</h4>

  <p>
    I love Arch. Why? Documentation. Documentation really is at the heart of the
    maintainers of Arch and I wouldn't have nearly the comptenency I do with
    Linux if it wasn't for the Arch document maintainer folks. That being said,
    I don't have as much time on my hands as I used to and my machine's dual
    Intel and NVidia 960M graphics card are so wonky right now with support
    between display servers, desktop environments, and the Linux kernels
    themselves, that Arch always ends up being a huge undertaking. On an ideal
    system I could install Arch with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind my
    back but my Dell 15 7559-763BLK laptop has such a hard time with graphics
    support that Arch could never be actualized.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been wanting to invest more experience in Manjaro for a long time and
    now seemed like the ideal moment. Manjaro even had the benefit of coming in
    a Community flavor of LXQt, yum. My favorite distro brought to life with a
    desktop environment that I think will be perfect for my VM needs. Booting it
    up on UEFI proved to take longer than I would have liked (from within
    VirtualBox) so I disabled UEFI boot and switched to booting from MBR. The
    MBR boot interface looks very nice and provided extra helpful options like
    booting directly into the firmware interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    The install process took some time; with the UEFI installation attempt I
    noticed the install seemed to freeze during the chfrootcfg step. According
    to
    <a
      href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-netinstall-edition-ready-for-public-testing/9956/21"
      >this post</a
    >, a mirror-list update needed to be done. Upon checking my mirrorlist by
    <span class="code">cat /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</span> I found that the
    top-ranking mirrors were in Africa and the US mirrors were towards the
    bottom. I followed the advice on the post and performed a
    <span class="code">pacman-mirrors -m rank --geoip</span> and rechecked the
    mirrorlist. This time the US mirrors were all that were listed. Retrying the
    whole process resulted in a (still slow but) progressing installation.
    Still, I didn't like the long start up time for this UEFI boot and instead
    did an install with UEFI boot turned off in VirtualBox. This setup is now my
    current main VirtualBox machine and is functioning extraordinarily.
  </p>

  <h4>Solus</h4>

  <p>
    Sticking with my theme of community/individually maintained distributions, I
    have been wanting to give Solus a shot after following it the past couple of
    months. The Budgie desktop looks phenomenal but uses 3D acceleration so it
    likely won't perform well in a VM with 3D acceleration disabled. Indeed,
    Ikey Doherty himself mentions that Solus is not optimized for running under
    a VM. But Solus has a great support line, a growing community, and a
    competent development team. I tried running it under a VM, but even with
    Mate I felt like I was limiting the potential for how great of a distro
    Solus is. So I decided to partition off some space on my physical hard drive
    on my Dell and booted up a Solus LiveCD using the Budgie DE.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coincidentally, the day after I decided to install Solus with the Budgie DE
    the Solus project released a new snapshot of their Solus distro, complete
    with Linux Driver Management, Budgie 10.3, clr-boot-manager, a GNOME
    flavor...seriously, this distro has ALL the goods. I was so thoroughly
    impressed that I replaced the prior Solus LiveCD with the new snapshot
    released on April 18, 2017 (today, as of this writing). After finally
    getting loaded up into the Live environment I was even more impressed; I was
    right in thinking the VM experience really did not do this distro justice.
    As is customary when testing my distros, I checked the resource management
    (my test showed a usage of about 400-450MB after a fresh boot), battery life
    (not great but we'll get to that later), and a brief assessment on ease of
    my workflow.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was very satisfied with my results and decided to install on the partition
    I created earlier. The install procedure recognized my ESP and correctly
    wrote an entry for Solus next to my existing Windows 10 entry. This is
    something that would seem so easy and yet I've had so many issues with this
    on a few other distros. A great example of how Solus keeps things that
    should be simple, simple. The install process continued to write and copy
    the necessary OS files to the partition and did so with surprising speed. In
    fact, Manjaro's LXQt install took 4 times as long to perform the copy
    despite being almost half the size, though this may have more to do with the
    fact that I only allowed 1 virtual processor in my VirtualBox setup.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Solus first launched there was a very noticeable lack of software
    available. I find that this is far from the case anymore. Rarely do I feel
    the need to load up a terminal and use the
    <span class="code">eopkg</span> package manager (which is also a great
    package manager in and of itself) to find and install extra software.
    Instead, the Solus Software Center provides very intuitive access to
    software categories. I easily found and installed Steam, Spotify, the GNOME
    web browser, my VS Code editor, Sublime, and a few other odds and ends
    packages that I use in my workflow.
  </p>
  <p>
    My only complaints about the system so far revolve around the graphics
    driver. Its not Solus's fault though; the driver support for NVidia cards is
    few and far between. As of this most recent snapshot the Linux Driver
    Management package comes with NVidia Optimus set with the dedicated GPU to
    always on (to my understanding). While this does not hamper the graphical
    experience in any way, it does have a tendency to drain the battery rapidly
    and tends to constantly cause my fans to run. This is certainly a necessary
    sacrifice to ensure that the Budgie desktop, display server, and intense 3D
    graphics (gaming) perform as expected. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival
    of the ability to swap between integrated and dedicated graphics card use
    though. This, along with the replacement to TLP that the Solus group is
    working on, should make the battery life of Solus much more useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're looking for a solid Linux system to try out that isn't beholden to
    corporate interests, or relies on the efforts of an upstream distro to
    release important updates, I <i>highly</i> recommend Solus.
