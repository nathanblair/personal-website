    Here is another major update to the website. A nominal cover photo has been
    included though this will likely change in the future. I've restructured the
    r&eacute;sum&eacute; and about sections, removed the images (as I didn't
    fully have permissions to release some of them), and am including these
    couple of blog posts. I'm still proud to share that this site runs fully
    javascript free and thus should be very performance-friendly. Meanwhile, a
    mobile/small-viewport version of the site is still in the works. The design
    has been mostly determined, what's left is the implementation and testing.
    This site is also still in desparate need of color and more attractive
    elements, a goal which remains high-priority and a problem I hope to remedy
    soon.

    From here on, blog posts will likely be less about this website and more
    about some of the projects I've built and am maintaining. Hopefully my work
    in some of these projects will inspire or help anyone who comes across them,
    much the same as others I've run across have helped me tremendously.
