    I am updating my website after a few months of no work being done to it.
    These changes will make the website more modern, aesthetic, easier to read
    and find, and provide a better demonstration of my progression as a
    developer.

    On the landing page, I'm embracing the cover photo design approach. It looks
    great; I like the simplicity. It is also very easy to work with when
    designing for responsive sites, which is what I hope to bring this site more
    in line with.
