        I am updating my website after a few months of no work being done to it. These changes will make the website more modern, aesthetic, easier to read and find, and provide a better demonstration of my progression as a developer.

        On the landing page, I'm embracing the cover photo design approach. It looks great; I like the simplicity. It is also very easy to work with when designing for responsive sites, which is what I hope to bring this site more in line with.
