    So. Its finally done. New domain name. New look. New theme. And...a new
    method of managing the static nature of this site. Because GitHub Pages is a
    static site hosting platform, my options were limited when it came to
    delivering updated articles/news/blogs. I've now created a solution that
    manages updating my articles across personal, tech-related, and general
    featured categories. Its probably not as feature rich as Jekyll but it is
    still very robust and most importantly, its <i>mine</i>. Lets talk a little
    more about what has changed in detail.
  </p>
  <h4>New Domain Name</h4>
  <p>
    nathanblair.rocks. Because I was so sick of typing in "Nate Blair" into
    Google and getting
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nate+blair&ie=&oe=#spf=1"
      >these search results</a
    >. I've tried to incorporate SEO practices into this site as much as
    possible but nateblair.info just wasn't going to compete against Gossip Girl
    fanfic. nathanblair.rocks on the other hand not only has a couple more
    degrees of search engine separation to Gossip Girl it also better fits my
    character. The .rocks TLD (top level domain) is playfully facetious which I
    think is a defining trait in my personality.
  </p>
  <h4>New Look/Theme</h4>
  <p>
    The website's new design is inspired by none other than Linux shell
    commands. I appreciate the open-source sentiment a lot and enjoy programming
    so what better way to mesh my site's theme and my persona than to use the
    look and feel of an operating system environment that parallels many of my
    own values. Hopefully you've caught on by now to the play-on-words/symbols
    used by the (clickable) nav-bar at the top of this page. Maybe you've even
    noticed the aptly styled nav-menu command (ls -h1 ~).
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a centralized/common layout on both desktop and mobile screens should
    help tremendously with user experience. Admittedly, the nav-menu has a
    slight-hiccup due to flex-boxes being hit or miss with webkit, so those of
    you using iOS mobile Safari browser will likely be missing out on the
    cleaner, optimal nav-menu and may have to scroll left or right a little to
    view all of the options. I am working on devising a fix for this currently.
  </p>
  <h4>Static Site Generator</h4>
  <p>
    The feature you've (I've) been waiting for. This article that I'm writing
    currently no longer needs to be manually ported into 3 different article
    categories, an appropriate preview extracted, so on and so forth. All of
    this work is now done manually. A node package retained right here within
    this site's directory does a directory walk, finds the relevant articles
    from the last 6 weeks, extracts a preview string from each one, stores it in
    a JS container, sorts the preview articles by their posting date, writes
    them into different categories of article indexes depending on the nature of
    their content, and then those category index pages are written to files that
    can be browsed right here on this blog page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Node packages are a tough animal to walk through a tech demo of, but if
    you're curious to see how I've created my own static site blog generation
    tool you can check out this site's
    <a href="https://github.com/nathanblair/nathanblair.github.io"
      >GitHub page</a
    >, navigate into the <span class="code">_bin</span> directory and look at
    the <span class="code">static-gen.js</span> file and related
    <span class="code">modules</span> directory.
