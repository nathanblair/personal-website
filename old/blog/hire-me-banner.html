    This site has been pretty cool to work on and I think its effective in
    telling my story but...it doesn't do a great job in achieving some of my
    metrics. Therefore, I'm shutting it down. Its been real guys.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously I'm kidding! I've worked <i>way</i> too hard on this site to just
    let it go now. Really though, this site could be doing a better job in
    generating higher CTR. What kind of metrics/CTR would a personal blog need?
    Why, a contact banner to hire me! So I made one. And now, I'm going to give
    a quick demo of how you can make one too. A lot of the UX basis for this
    widget is going to come from the
    <a href="nathanblair.rocks/blog/tech/pure-css-toggleable-dropdown/#header"
      >pure CSS nav menu
    </a>
    discussed in one of my previous posts. Let's. Get. Started.
  </p>
  <h4>The HTML</h4>
  <p>
    I love simple HTML. This widget is no different! I embedded my banner in an
    <span class="code">&lt;aside&gt;</span> tag because (<i>ahem</i>) we're
    going to <i>cast it aside</i>, now how about that? Ugh. Moving on! We're
    putting our old friends the checkbox and its label, along with an anchor tag
    that will use the mailto URL fragment, into this aside element. Here's what
    that looks like:
  </p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    &lt;aside class="banner"&gt;<br />
    <span class="indent">&lt;input type="checkbox" id="box"/&gt;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">&lt;label id="toggle" for="box"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</span
    ><br /><br />
    <span class="indent">&lt;a id="collapsible" href="mailto:me@email.com?</span
    ><br />
    <span class="indent"
      >subject=Opportunities (From website.com)&amp;body=</span
    ><br />
    <span class="indent">Blah blah blah blah blah.%0D%0A</span><br />
    <span class="indent"
      >Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah? Here's my contact information:
      %0D%0A%0D%0A</span
    ><br />
    <br />
    <span class="indent">Name: %0D%0A</span><br />
    <span class="indent">Phone: %0D%0A</span><br />
    <span class="indent">E-Mail: %0D%0A%0D%0A</span><br />
    <br />
    <span class="indent">Thanks,%0D%0A%0D%0A&gt;"</span><br />
    <span class="double-indent">Ready to hire me? Send me an e-mail!</span
    ><br />
    <span class="indent">&lt;/a&gt;</span><br />
    &lt;/aside&gt;<br />
  </section>
  <p>
    Bam. HTML's done. Simple! I love it. I only wish the CSS were quite so
    easy...
  </p>
  <h4>The CSS</h4>
  <p>
    Let's start with the banner itself. This element, for me, is something I
    want prominently (but not annoyingly) displayed at all times. So I'm going
    to set it as a fixed position element, somewhere near the top right corner
    of the page. Out of the way but accessible if someone decides they want to
    get a hold of me about an opportunity! Inside this
    <span class="code">&lt;aside&gt;</span> container is the checkbox, its
    label, and the anchor itself. All four of these need to be styled. You'll
    notice the styling of the checkbox and its label should be pretty similar to
    the dropdown widget's style. First, the banner:
  </p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    .banner {<br />
    <span class="indent">position: fixed;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">top: 100px;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">right: 20px;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">font-size: 1.1em;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">text-align: center;</span><br />
    }
  </section>
  <p>The checkbox graphic is very easy.</p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    #box {<br />
    <span class="indent">display: none;</span><br />
    }
  </section>
  <p>
    That one's done. Next, the shared settings for the checkbox label and the
    anchor link.
  </p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    #toggle, #collapsible {<br />
    <span class="indent">display: block;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">color: white;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">text-decoration: none;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">cursor: pointer;</span><br />
    }
  </section>
  <p>
    And then the individual settings for the checkbox label and anchor link.
  </p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    #toggle {<br />
    <span class="indent">float: left;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">background-color: rgba(250, 0, 0, 0.7)</span><br />
    <span class="indent">padding: 10px 6px 10px 10px;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">/*border-bottom-left-radius: 2px;*/</span><br />
    <span class="indent">/*border-top-left-radius: 2px;*/</span><br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    #collapsible {<br />
    <span class="indent">float: right;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">background-color: rgba(220, 70, 0, 0.7)</span><br />
    <span class="indent">padding: 10px 16px 10px 4px;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">/*border-bottom-right-radius: 2px;*/</span><br />
    <span class="indent">/*border-top-right-radius: 2px;*/</span><br />
    <span class="indent">white-space: nowrap;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">transition: padding 1s;</span><br />
    }
  </section>
  <p>
    Note that I have not set a width for the #collapsible element; this prevents
    me from animating the full width shrinking effect but I can't stress how
    much I dislike hard coding those kinds of things. It only leads to site
    problems and bad user experiences. Anyway, I've also included the nowrap
    settings for the white-space property. As the #collapsible shrinks the text
    will get pushed and automatically wrap itself downward, expanding the height
    of the entire .banner. In turn, this makes the #toggle look funny. Best to
    just avoid that altogether and set a nowrap!
  </p>
  <p>
    That wraps up (huehue) the display of all the elements. Now we need to
    implement their behavior using our friend the checkbox's
    <span class="code">:checked</span> pseudo-class. I left the label's
    container devoid of any content so that I could set it using the #toggle's
    <span class="code">:after</span> pseudo-class. When the checkbox is not
    checked, the label shows a fitting '/&gt;' close tag that demonstrates that
    clicking the anchor will collapse the banner. After clicking the '/&gt;'
    close tag the checkbox gets checked, the collapse "animation" triggers, and
    the display of the label changes to the '&lt;' open tag. The settings for
    the #collapsible element are there to round out the transition effects and
    make sure it looks good.
  </p>
  <section class="blockcode">
    #box ~ #toggle:after {<br />
    <span class="indent">content: "/&gt;";</span><br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    #box:checked ~ #toggle:after {<br />
    <span class="indent">content: "&lt;";</span><br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    #box:checked ~ #collapsible {<br />
    <span class="indent">width: 0;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">padding: 10px 0;</span><br />
    <span class="indent">overflow: hidden;</span><br />
    }
  </section>
  <p>And that's it. Another fun, pure CSS widget done!</p>
