    <h1>My name is Nathan Blair.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a proud millennial, tech enthusiast, and lifelong learner. I hold two
      Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and
      Engineering. My alma mater is technically Wright State University in
      Dayton, OH but I attended the University of Cincinnati during my first
      three years of college and will always consider myself a Bearcat at heart.

      My areas of professional experience include steelmaking, failure analysis,
      MEMS, electronic device characterization and fabrication, software
      development and automation, systems administration, and swimming pool
      maintenance. I'm an extremely diverse individual and have a wide array of
      interests. It stems from the fact that I have an addiction to solving
      challenging problems and a never-ending desire to learn.

      Outside of my professional life I am an avid motorcyclist and musician.
      When I'm not getting my wind therapy, I can be found jamming on drum sets,
      guitar, and occassionally the piano. My personal aspirations are to just
      be a good person each day, leaving the world a little better than the day
      before. To accomplish this on a larger scale I am committed to advocating
      renewable and sustainable energy technology and helping those that live a
      life less fortunate than I.

    <p>
      I'm interested in talking with people that share my commitment to
      continuous education, a sustainable world, and open-mindedness. I see a
      lot of potential in my generation to shape the world and I'm always open
      to having discussions about ways to improve our future. Contact me if you
      want to chat about cool things or would like to work on a project with me!
