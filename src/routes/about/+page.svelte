	A proud millennial, tech enthusiast, and lifelong learner, I hold two
	Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and
	Engineering. My alma mater is technically Wright State University in Dayton,
	OH but I attended the University of Cincinnati during my first three years of
	college and will always consider myself a Bearcat at heart.

	My areas of professional experience include steelmaking, failure analysis,
	MEMS, electronic device characterization and fabrication, software development
	and automation, systems administration, and swimming pool maintenance. I'm an
	extremely diverse individual and have a wide array of interests. It stems from
	the fact that I have an addiction to solving challenging problems and a
	never-ending desire to learn.

	Outside of my professional life I am an avid motorcyclist and musician. When
	I'm not getting my wind therapy, I can be found jamming on drum sets, guitar,
	and occassionally the piano. My personal aspirations are to be a good person
	each day, leaving the world a little better than the day before. To accomplish
	this on a larger scale I am committed to advocating renewable and sustainable
	energy technology and volunteering when and where I can.

	I'm interested in talking with people that share my commitment to continuous
	education, a sustainable world, and open-mindedness. I see a lot of potential
	in my generation to shape the world and I'm always open to having discussions
	about ways to improve our future. Contact me if you want to chat about cool
	things or would like to work on a project with me!
